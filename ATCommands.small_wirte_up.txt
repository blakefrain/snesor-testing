The arduino has a software serial connection to the sim800l module witch is what conects to the cell network if i send these serial commands to the module. I received the date that i need withc is the "temperature,device=arduino01 value=83.2". When I put this into the script I have attached it does not work correctly. I dont receive the data. I would also like to see what the sim800l module says back after the command is sent but this is also not doing that.
